<p class="p9">In 2015, the hockey player began dating 21-year-old model Anastasia Shubskaya, the daughter of actress Vera Glagoleva and millionaire Kirill Shubsky. They met at the Beijing Olympics (2008), but did not maintain a relationship for a long time. In 2015, the girl almost drowned in Dubai and told about the incident to her Instagram subscribers. Among them was Ovechkin. Concerned about Nastya's condition, he decided to support her personally. So their whirlwind romance began, which ended with a magnificent wedding. The celebration took place in July 2017. In 2018, Ovechkin received two major gifts from fate: his team won the Stanley Cup, and his young wife Anastasia became pregnant. On August 18, their son was born, the first child of both Ovi and Shubskaya.
